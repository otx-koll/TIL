## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
- `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
> 
> **Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, pick = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`

## Solution
### Code
```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

        if(guess(n) == 0) {
            return n;
        }

        int start = 1;
        int end = n;

        while(start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if(guess(mid) == 0) {
                return mid;
            }
            if(guess(mid) == -1) {
                end = mid - 1;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
