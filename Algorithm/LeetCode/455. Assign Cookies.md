## Description
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

아이들이 쿠키를 원하는 정도를 고려하여 얼마나 만족하는지 최대 수를 출력하라

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** g = \[1,2,3], s = \[1,1]
> 
> **Output:** 1
> 
> **Explanation:** You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
> 
> And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
> 
> You need to output 1.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** g = \[1,2], s = \[1,2,3]
> 
> **Output:** 2
> 
> **Explanation:** You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
> 
> You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
> 
> You need to output 2.
 
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= g.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        /*
        approach
        g와 s를 오름차순으로 정렬하고 g요소가 s요소보다 작거나 같으면 각 인덱스를 1증가시키고 cnt도 증가한다.
        인덱스가 배열의 길이보다 많아지면 즉시 루프를 종료하고 cnt를 반환한다.

        time complexity : O(nlogn)

        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int cnt = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        while(i < g.length && j < s.length) {
            if(g[i] <= s[j]) {
                cnt++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
```
