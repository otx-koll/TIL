## Description
There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:

- `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return _the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations_.

++X, X++일 때 1 증가하고 --X, X--일 때 1 감소한 최종 값 반환

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** operations = \["--X","X++","X++"]
> 
> **Output:** 1
> 
> **Explanation:** The operations are performed as follows:
> 
> Initially, X = 0.
> 
> --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** operations = \["++X","++X","X++"]
> 
> **Output:** 3
> 
> **Explanation:** The operations are performed as follows:
> 
> Initially, X = 0.
> 
> ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
> 
> ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** operations = \["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
> 
> **Output:** 0
> 
> **Explanation:** The operations are performed as follows:
> 
> Initially, X = 0.
> 
> X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
> 
> ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
> 
> --X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
> 
> X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
- `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.

## Solution
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        /*
        approach
        operations의 각 인덱스가 "++X" 또는 "X++"와 동일하면 x를 증가시키고, 아니라면 감소시킨다.

        time complexity : O(n)

        int x = 0;
        for(String s : operations) {
            if(s.charAt(1) == '+') {
                x++;
            } else {
                x--;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```
