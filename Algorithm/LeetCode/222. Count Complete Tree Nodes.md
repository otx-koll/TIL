## Description

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

전체 트리 노드 계산

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = \[1,2,3,4,5,6]
> 
> **Output:** 6

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** root = []
> 
> **Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** root = \[1]
> 
> **Output:** 1
 
**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
```

## Solution
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        /*
        approach
        재귀적으로 각 서브트리의 노드 수를 세고, 이를 합산한다.

        time complexity : O(n)

        if(root == null) return 0;

        int left = countNode(root.left);
        int right = countNode(root.right);

        return left + right + 1;
    }
}
```
